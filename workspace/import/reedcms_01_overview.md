# ReedCMS-01-Overview.md

## What is ReedCMS?

**ReedCMS** is a modern, Rust-based Content Management System that combines the power of Rust with the elegance of modern web technologies. It's designed as a **Content Orchestration Engine** rather than a traditional content management system.

## The Name "Reed"

Reed is a brilliant double meaning:
- **Botanical:** Reed (Schilf) symbolizes organic growth, flexibility, and natural development
- **Content-Related:** Reed sounds like "Read" - the core function of any CMS is to read and consume content
- **4k Demo Scene Philosophy:** Like reed, ReedCMS grows upright, minimal yet powerful

The name perfectly embodies the vision: A CMS that grows like a "bright green sprout reaching toward the radiant sky" - organic and elegant, yet enterprise-ready.

## Core Innovation: Universal Content Graph

**The Problem:** Traditional CMSs suffer from database explosion - separate tables for pages, menus, categories, search indexes, permissions, and custom fields. This leads to complex JOINs, query optimization nightmares, and architectural bloat.

**ReedCMS Solution:** Everything is an entity with associations in a Universal Content Graph. One pattern handles:
- Content hierarchies (pages with nested sections)
- Menu structures (navigation with submenus)  
- Meta-snippet compositions (reusable component definitions)
- Search indexing (word-entity relationships)
- Taxonomies and categories (content classification)

**Result:** Predictable O(1) performance, no complex queries, infinite flexibility.

## Content Orchestration vs Content Management

Traditional CMSs **manage** content in isolated silos:
```
Pages Table + Posts Table + Menus Table + Categories Table + 
Custom Fields Table + Search Index + Cache Layer...
```

ReedCMS **orchestrates** content through unified patterns:
```
Universal Content Graph (entities + associations) = Everything
```

## Core Concepts Preview

### 4-Layer Architecture
- **CSV Layer:** Configuration and schema definitions (Git-versionable)
- **PostgreSQL Main:** Live content and business data (ACID, i18n)
- **PostgreSQL UCG:** Structure backup (compressed, recovery-only)
- **Redis Layer:** Performance cache and search index (sub-millisecond)

*Details in ReedCMS-02-Architecture.md*

### Snippet System
Everything is a **snippet** - reusable content components with:
- Type-safe field definitions
- Auto-generated templates and Web Components  
- Registry-based validation and optimization
- Universal association patterns

*Details in ReedCMS-04-Registry.md*

### Developer Experience
- **KISS-Brain Principle:** Mentally predictable operations
- **CLI-First:** Human-readable commands with semantic names
- **Hot Reload:** Development server with instant updates
- **Type Safety:** Rust compile-time + runtime validation

*Details in ReedCMS-05-CLI.md*

### Template System  
- **Web Components + Tera:** Server-side rendering with client-side interactivity
- **Mobile-First:** Performance budgets and battery awareness
- **Auto-Generation:** Templates created from CSV definitions
- **Asset Pipeline:** Tree-shaking and optimization

*Details in ReedCMS-06-Templates.md*

## Performance Characteristics

```
Entity Queries:        0.1ms   (Redis direct lookup)
Content Queries:       1-2ms   (PostgreSQL, no JOINs)
Search Queries:        0.5ms   (Redis set operations)
Combined Operations:   1.5ms   (optimized multi-layer)
```

**Memory Efficiency:**
- Small site (1K snippets): ~20MB total
- Large site (100K snippets): ~1.3GB total
- Linear scaling with no performance cliffs

**Deployment:**
- Single Rust binary
- Configuration via CSV files
- Zero-downtime updates
- Automatic index generation

## Philosophy: 4k Demo Scene Principles

**Every line of code has a clear purpose:**
- No bloat, no unused features
- Minimal API surface with maximum power
- Elegant architecture without complexity
- Load exactly what you need, when you need it

**Stunning code quality for code reviews:**
- Self-documenting patterns
- Predictable behavior
- Easy debugging and maintenance
- Clear separation of concerns

## Why ReedCMS Exists

Traditional CMSs force developers to choose between:
- **Performance OR Flexibility** (fast but rigid vs slow but customizable)
- **Simple OR Powerful** (easy but limited vs complex but capable)  
- **Modern OR Mature** (cutting-edge but unproven vs stable but outdated)

**ReedCMS provides all three:**
- Performance AND Flexibility through Universal Content Graph
- Simple AND Powerful through KISS-brain architecture
- Modern AND Mature through proven patterns in new technology

The result is a CMS that grows with your needs without growing complex, scales without performance cliffs, and remains maintainable as projects evolve.
